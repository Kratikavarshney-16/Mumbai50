Data was collected through the GitHub API, specifically targeting users located in Mumbai with over 50 followers. Additional details such as bio, company, and number of followers were retrieved for a comprehensive profile.
Many developers in Mumbai have followings in the thousands, indicating high visibility. A large portion of users include their professional titles, roles, or key technical skills in their bio, making it easier for recruiters and peers to understand their expertise at a glance.
Given that high followings are associated with increased visibility, developers should actively engage with followers through projects and collaborations, especially if aiming to build a strong personal brand in the tech community.
